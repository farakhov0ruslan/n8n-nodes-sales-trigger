# n8n-nodes-sales-trigger

This is an **n8n community node** for **SalesTrigger**. It allows you to push leads into SalesTrigger campaigns via API, including sending up to ten custom messages to each lead.

[SalesTrigger](https://www.salestrigger.io/) is a platform that analyzes the behavior of prospects (event attendance, intent signals, interaction patterns) and surfaces who you should reach out to right now. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Usage

Here‚Äôs how to use the node in your workflows:

### Setup

* After installing the node and providing credentials, drag **SalesTrigger: Add Lead to Campaign** into your workflow.
* Select your credentials.
* Use **Campaign Name or ID** dropdown (auto-loaded) or enter an expression.
* Provide the **LinkedIn URL** of your lead (`https://www.linkedin.com/in/<PUBLIC-ID>/`).
* Optionally fill **Message 1..10** ‚Äî each maps to `custom_field_1..custom_field_10`.

### Execution

* On **Execute**, the node sends a POST request to `/beta/campaign/{campaignId}/api-add-lead`.
* If successful, the API returns status **201 Created**.
* On error (e.g. 422), the UI shows a descriptive error:

  ```
  [422] Assertion failed, Lead href must be a pattern of https://www.linkedin.com/in/{PUBLIC-ID} ‚Äî no extra details
  ```

Enable **Continue On Fail** if you're processing many items and want the workflow to continue past errors.
